# AI Job Search Dashboard & Application Prep Hub
_Last updated: April 17, 2026_

## 1. Product Definition

Build a **job search dashboard and application-prep hub for designers**.

This is **not** a full auto-apply bot in the first phase.

The product should help a designer:

- automatically discover relevant jobs
- prioritize **quality-first** opportunities
- filter for **remote-only**
- evaluate salary potential
- support **graphic design + adjacent roles**
- generate all application materials needed for each job
- prepare field-by-field content for manual submission
- adapt the resume per job while keeping **one core user profile**

## 2. Product Goal

Create a system that behaves like a **designer job operating system**, not a spray-and-pray tracker.

The product should answer:

- Which jobs are worth applying to?
- Which remote roles are highest quality?
- Which roles fit the user's real experience and portfolio?
- Which resume version and portfolio link should be used?
- What text should be pasted into each application field?
- What has already been applied to, skipped, or followed up on?

## 3. Phase 1 Scope

Phase 1 is a **job discovery, ranking, and application-prep system**.

It should:

- collect jobs from a small set of sources
- normalize and deduplicate job records
- score jobs against one canonical user profile
- rank remote roles by quality first and salary second
- support designer-first and adjacent design roles
- let the user shortlist, dismiss, and track jobs
- generate application materials for **manual** submission

Phase 1 does **not** include direct application submission automation.

## 4. Confirmed Product Rules

- Primary user is a designer; adjacent design roles are allowed when fit is strong.
- Each user has **one core profile**.
- Resume tailoring happens **per job** from that source profile.
- Remote is a **hard requirement**.
- Quality and salary are the most important ranking factors after remote.
- Portfolio strategy is first-class, not an afterthought.
- AI should prepare application content, but the user stays in control of the final submission.

## 5. Recommended Stack

- **Next.js** for the internal dashboard and application-prep workspace
- **Supabase** for Postgres, storage, and future auth if the product expands beyond internal use
- **GitHub** for source control, issue tracking, and CI/CD
- **OpenAI / Anthropic / Google models** routed by task for parsing, scoring, and generation
- **Playwright** later for browser-assisted workflows, once manual apply prep is working
- **PostHog** later for product analytics and funnel instrumentation
- **Sentry** later for production error monitoring

## 6. Current Foundation

The repo ships a Next.js + Supabase foundation with real discovery, ranking, and packet-prep surfaces on top of the planning docs.
The product is currently set up as a **single-user internal tool**, so there is no login flow in Phase 1.

- `app/` -> App Router layout, homepage, ranked jobs dashboard, job detail route, packet review route, operators setup, and health/audit endpoints
- `app/profile/` -> single-user operator workspace with one freeform search brief plus structured profile, resume, and portfolio data
- `app/jobs/[jobId]` -> job detail route with score breakdown, fit reasons, red flags, and prep-open workflow actions
- `app/jobs/[jobId]/packet` -> packet review screen with editable resume version, cover letter, checklist, and structured application answers
- `app/api/jobs/import` -> import/refresh diagnostics endpoint for ingestion runs
- `lib/` -> shared product constants, scoring weights, model routing, domain types, AI task contracts, and Supabase helpers
- `lib/jobs/` -> source registry, company watchlist, Greenhouse ATS importer, deterministic dedupe, remote + designer-first import gates, and the workflow-learning loop that reweights ranking from shortlist/dismiss/apply signals
- `supabase/` -> migrations, seed data, and local project config
- `.env.example` -> required Supabase public URL plus the server-only service role key for internal writes
- `CLAUDE.md` -> canonical AI entrypoint (hard rules, doc map, scope discipline, verification commands)
- `README.md` / `PRD.md` / `SCHEMA.md` / `SCORING.md` / `TASKS.md` / `DECISIONS.md` / `DESIGN.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `UI_CHANGE_PROTOCOL.md` -> durable product and repo context

## 7. Local Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js `20.9+`
- npm `10+`

Commands:

1. `cp .env.example .env.local`
2. fill in the Supabase URL, publishable key, and service role key
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

Notes:

- No external auth is required right now; the app uses local operator selection instead.
- The app reads and writes against one seeded internal operator profile.
- The first preference input should be one freeform search brief, not a long questionnaire.
- Server-side profile reads and writes should use the service role key, not the public publishable key.

Useful scripts:

Baseline checks:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run check:ui-system`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check` — runs lint, typecheck, ui-system audit, and build in sequence

Quality harness (see `docs/repo-harness.md`):

- `npm run eval` — full 4-layer eval (100-point score)
- `npm run eval:correctness`
- `npm run eval:workflows`
- `npm run eval:ui`
- `npm run eval:ui-artifacts`
- `npm run capture:ui` — regenerate UI review screenshots only

Targeted smokes (feed into `eval:workflows`):

- `npm run smoke:import-contract`
- `npm run smoke:routes`
- `npm run smoke:packet`
- `npm run smoke:packet-persistence`
- `npm run smoke:server-action-workflow`
- `npm run smoke:workflow-state`
- `npm run smoke:workflow-transition`
- `npm run smoke:resume-v4`

Live diagnostics (non-gating, separate from eval):

- `npm run diagnostic:external-sourcing`

One-offs:

- `npm run backfill:job-review-copy`
- `npm run cleanup:packet-generation`
- `npm run deploy:cloud-run`

## 8.5 Quality Harness

The repo now has one standard quality gate:

- `npm run eval`

It runs the full repo harness across correctness, workflows, UI assertions, and UI review evidence, then writes:

- `.codex-artifacts/eval/latest/report.json`
- `.codex-artifacts/eval/latest/report.md`
- `.codex-artifacts/eval/latest/ui/`

See `docs/repo-harness.md` for the layer breakdown and scoring model.

## 8. Deployment

The app now supports a direct Google Cloud Run deployment flow.

- deployment guide: `docs/cloud-run-deployment.md`
- default service name: `doomscrollingjobs-web`
- default region: `northamerica-northeast1`
- default access mode: public

GitHub is now the deployment source of truth: pushes to `main` deploy the service through GitHub Actions.

## 9. Project Structure

Current structure and intended ownership:

- `app/` -> Next.js routes, layouts, and server actions
- `lib/config/` -> site metadata and product rails
- `lib/domain/` -> typed product entities and workflow enums
- `lib/scoring/` -> ranking weights and future evaluator logic
- `lib/ai/` -> task-based model routing and prompt orchestration
- `lib/supabase/` -> public and server-only Supabase clients for the internal operator setup
- `supabase/` -> SQL schema, policies, seeds, and local config
- `docs/` -> later home for long-form docs if the root gets too crowded

## 10. Next Steps

Current priorities (see `TASKS.md` for the full execution checklist):

1. Harden the packet lifecycle so saved packets, resume versions, workflow moves, and application events stay fully in sync.
2. Add a practical resume PDF export flow from saved `resume_versions`.
3. Add saved searches and reusable dashboard filter presets backed by `saved_searches`.
4. Wire the `prompts` table into real task contracts for scoring and packet-generation work.
5. Add a job activity timeline view with status history, packet linkage, and manual notes.

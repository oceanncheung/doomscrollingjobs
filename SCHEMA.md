# Initial Data Model

_Date: April 1, 2026_

## 1. Modeling Principles

- One user has one canonical profile.
- Resume tailoring creates job-specific versions, not alternate identities.
- Job normalization and scoring are separate concerns.
- Application prep outputs are stored as structured artifacts, not just blobs of AI text.
- The schema should support multi-user operation later, even if the initial product is effectively single-user.

## 2. Shared Conventions

- Primary keys use `uuid`.
- Timestamps use `timestamptz`.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` exist on all user-owned records.
- Soft deletion is optional later; Phase 1 can use active/inactive states where needed.
- Enumerated values should be implemented as Postgres enums or constrained text once the schema moves into Supabase.

## 5. Relationship Summary

- `users` 1 -> 1 `user_profiles`

- `users` 1 -> many `resume_versions`
- `jobs` 1 -> many `job_scores`
- `jobs` 1 -> many `application_packets`
- `application_packets` 1 -> many `application_answers`
- `jobs` and `application_packets` 1 -> many `application_events`

## 6. Phase 1 Notes

- `job_scores` should be recomputable, but the latest explanation and recommendation should be persisted for the dashboard.
- `application_packets` should store structured recommendation data rather than a single generated document blob.
- `resume_versions` should remain auditable against the source resume so tailoring stays truthful.
- The initial schema is intentionally biased toward strong contracts for ranking and packet generation before source expansion or automation.

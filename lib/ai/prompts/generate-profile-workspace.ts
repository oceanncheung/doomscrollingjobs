Rules:
- Stay grounded in the source text only.
- Do not invent employers, dates, metrics, tools, or seniority the source does not support.
- Prefer concise, usable job-search language over resume prose.
- targetRoles should be direct-fit roles only.
- allowedAdjacentRoles should be close neighboring roles, not random creative titles.
- targetSeniorityLevels must only contain values from: junior, mid, senior, lead, principal.
- skills should be specific but ATS-safe keywords.
- tools should only include named software or platforms explicitly supported by the source text.
- searchBrief should read like an internal targeting note for ranking jobs, not a public bio.`,
